#         Order of construction of derived classes
---

> When C++ constructs derived objects, it does so in phases. First, the most-base class (at the top of the inheritance tree) is constructed first. Then each child class is constructed in order, until the most-child class (at the bottom of the inheritance tree) is constructed last.

> **Multiple inheritance** enables a derived class to inherit members from more than one parent.

## `Problems with multiple inheritance`

>  Ambiguity can result when multiple base classes contain a function with the same name.

```c
#include <iostream>
 
class USBDevice
{
private:
    long m_id;
 
public:
    USBDevice(long id)
        : m_id(id)
    {
    }
 
    long getID() { return m_id; }
};
 
class NetworkDevice
{
private:
    long m_id;
 
public:
    NetworkDevice(long id)
        : m_id(id)
    {
    }
 
    long getID() { return m_id; }
};
 
class WirelessAdapter: public USBDevice, public NetworkDevice
{
public:
    WirelessAdapter(long usbId, long networkId)
        : USBDevice(usbId), NetworkDevice(networkId)
    {
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    WirelessAdapter c54G(5442, 181742);
    std::cout << c54G.getID(); // Which getID() do we call?
 
    return 0;
}
```

> When c54G.getID() is compiled, the compiler looks to see if WirelessAdapter contains a function named getID(). It doesn’t. The compiler then looks to see if any of the parent classes have a function named getID(). See the problem here? The problem is that c54G actually contains TWO getID() functions: one inherited from USBDevice, and one inherited from NetworkDevice. Consequently, this function call is ambiguous, and you will receive a compiler error if you try to compile it


> However, there is a way to work around this problem: you can explicitly specify which version you meant to call:

```c
int main()
{
    WirelessAdapter c54G(5442, 181742);
    std::cout << c54G.USBDevice::getID();
 
    return 0;
}
```

> While this workaround is pretty simple, you can see how things can get complex when your class inherits from four or six base classes, which inherit from other classes themselves. The potential for naming conflicts increases exponentially as you inherit more classes, and each of these naming conflicts needs to be resolved explicitly.



> More serious is the diamond problem, which your author likes to call the “diamond of doom”. This occurs when a class multiply inherits from two classes which each inherit from a single base class. This leads to a diamond shaped inheritance pattern.

> There are many issues that arise in this context, including whether Copier should have one or two copies of PoweredDevice, and how to resolve certain types of ambiguous references. While most of these issues can be addressed through explicit scoping, the maintenance overhead added to your classes in order to deal with the added complexity can cause development time to skyrocket. 


> **Rule**: Avoid multiple inheritance unless alternatives lead to more complexity.

> A **container class** is a class designed to hold and organize multiple instances of another type (either another class, or a fundamental type).


## `Types of containers`

> Container classes generally come in two different varieties. **Value containers** are compositions that store copies of the objects that they are holding (and thus are responsible for creating and destroying those copies). **Reference containers** are aggregations that store pointers or references to other objects (and thus are not responsible for creation or destruction of those objects).
